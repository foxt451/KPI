#2. C++ Data Types
---------------------------------------------------------
C++ Fundamental Data Types
The table below shows the fundamental data types, 
their meaning, and their sizes (in bytes):

Data Type   |	Meaning		      |	Size (in Bytes)
---------------------------------------------------------
int	    |   Integer		      |	2 or 4
float	    |	Floating-point	      |	4
double	    |	Double Floating-point |	8
char	    |	Character     	      |	1
wchar_t	    |	Wide Character	      |	2
bool	    |	Boolean		      |	1
void	    |	Empty		      |	0
---------------------------------------------------------

1. C++ int
The int keyword is used to indicate integers.
Its size is usually 4 bytes. Meaning, it can store values from -2147483648 to 2147483647.
For example: int salary = 85000;
---------------------------------------------------------
2. C++ float and double
float and double are used to store floating-point numbers (decimals and exponentials).
The size of float is 4 bytes and the size of double is 8 bytes. 
Hence, double has two times the precision of float.
For example:
-float area = 64.74;
-double volume = 134.64534;

---------------------------------------------------------
3. C++ char
Keyword char is used for characters.
Its size is 1 byte.
Characters in C++ are enclosed inside single quotes ' '.
For example:
-char test = 'h';
Note: In C++, an integer value is stored in a char variable rather than the character itself.

---------------------------------------------------------
4. C++ wchar_t
Wide character wchar_t is similar to the char data type, except its size is 2 bytes instead of 1.
It is used to represent characters that require more memory to represent them than a single char.
For example:
wchar_t test = L'◊ù'  // storing Hebrew character;

Notice the letter L before the quotation marks.

Note: There are also two other fixed-size character types char16_t and char32_t introduced in C++11.

---------------------------------------------------------
5. C++ bool
The bool data type has one of two possible values: true or false.
Booleans are used in conditional statements and loops (which we will learn in later chapters).
For example,
bool cond = false;

---------------------------------------------------------
6. C++ void
The void keyword indicates an absence of data. It means "nothing" or "no value".
We will use void when we learn about functions and pointers.
Note: We cannot declare variables of the void type.

---------------------------------------------------------
C++ Type Modifiers
We can further modify some of the fundamental data types by using type modifiers. 
There are 4 type modifiers in C++. They are:
-signed
-unsigned
-short
-long
We can modify the following data types with the above modifiers:
-int
-double
-char

C++ Modified Data Types List
Data Type	   |   Size (in Bytes)| Meaning
---------------------------------------------------------
signed int	   |	4	      |	used for integers (equivalent to int)
unsigned int	   |	4	      |	can only store positive integers
short		   |	2	      |	used for small integers (range -32768 to 32767)
unsigned short	   |	2	      |	used for small positive integers (range 0 to 65,535)
long	at least   |	4	      |	used for large integers (equivalent to long int)
unsigned long	   |	4	      |	used for large positive integers or 0 (equivalent to unsigned long int)
long long	   |	8	      |	used for very large integers (equivalent to long long int).
unsigned long long |	8	      |	used for very large positive integers or 0 (equivalent to unsigned long long int)
long double	   |	12	      |	used for large floating-point numbers
signed char	   |	1	      |	used for characters (guaranteed range -127 to 127)
unsigned char	   |	1	      |	used for characters (range 0 to 255)
